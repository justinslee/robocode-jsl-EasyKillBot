Once it has locked on to a robot it attempts to remain locked until the robot either leaves the range of the radar.\r\n\r\n### Firing:  \r\nEasyKillBot fires more powerful bullets the closer it is to its target.  It fires only when it has a lock on the target tank.\r\n\r\n### Vulnerabilities:  \r\nEasyKillBot fires constantly at last known enemy position.  It is weak against good evasive bots or bots that never return to the same line of sight of the bullets.  This weakness can be fixed with a targeting algorithm. Also it does not track until it moves to its goal initially. \r\n\r\nYou can also view in more detail the current API documentation by clicking [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/justinslee/robocode-jsl-EasyKillBot/blob/master/doc/index.html). \r\n\r\n# Project Details: \r\n\r\n### Documentation: \r\n\r\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/justinslee/robocode-jsl-EasyKillBot/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n* [Developer Guide](https://github.com/justinslee/robocode-jsl-EasyKillBot/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n* [API Documentation] (http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/justinslee/robocode-jsl-EasyKillBot/blob/master/doc/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Project Community:\r\n\r\n* [Requests Page] (https://github.com/justinslee/robocode-jsl-EasyKillBot/wiki/Requests)\r\n* [Contact Us](https://github.com/justinslee/robocode-jsl-EasyKillBot/wiki/Contact-Us)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
