{"name":"Robocode-jsl-easykillbot","tagline":"Repository for EasyKillBot","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Movement:  EasyKillBot moves to center of the playing field then moves in a circle of a chosen size. \r\n\r\n###Targeting:  EasyKillBot scans for a robot. Once it has locked on to a robot it attempts to remain locked until the robot either leaves the range of the radar.\r\n\r\n###Firing:  EasyKillBot fires more powerful bullets the closer it is to its target.  It fires only when it has a lock on the target tank.\r\n\r\n###Vulnerabilities:  EasyKillBot fires constantly at last known enemy position.  It is weak against good evasive bots or bots that never return to the same line of sight of the bullets.  This weakness can be fixed with a targeting algorithm. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
